                  A business has various ways of mobilizing financial resources required to finance plans. These ways are broadly classified as sources of funds and sources of income.
                  For sources of income, a business engages in income generating activities which generate various income for the business.
                  For sources of funds, on the other hand, a business mobilizes funding from various providers of funding who do so of an associated cost.
                </p>

                <h2>Sources of funds</h2>
                <p>
                  Its classified under various categories i.e.<br/>
	                <strong>long-term sources</strong> of funding and 
                  <strong>short-term sources</strong> of funding
                  <strong>internal sources</strong> and 
                  <strong>external sources</strong> of funds.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Long-term and short-term sources</h4>
                <p>
                  Classification of funding based on the maturity period of the funds. 
                  The period within which the funding is repayable.
                  Due consideration should be given to the repayment period to ensure that various sources of funding are directed to financing various ../assets / initiatives which will pay back within the same period.
                </p>

                <h5>Long-term sources of funds</h5>
                <p>
                  When the funding is mobilized is repayable after a long period of time usually exceeding 5 years it might be consider as a long-term source of fund.
                  Long term sources of fund have the characteristics that they are used to raise large amount of money and the financing of capital items/ expenditures (items that will last in the business for a long period of time usually beyond 1 year i.e. land, building, furniture and equipment) .
                  Long term sources of funds: share capital, long-term loans, lease financing, venture capital, mortgages, retained profits.

                <p>
                  <strong>a. Shared capital</strong>:

                <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
                  <b>Ordinary shares/ equity:</b> shares that are bought by ordinary shareholder of the company. These are shareholders who are actual owners on the business who therefor share in the profits and losses of the business and are involved in the decision of the company therefor they have control over the management of the company.<br/>
	                <b>Preference shares:</b> are preferred shares in the sense that they share in the profits whether the business makes profits or loses. This is though predetermined percentage which is fixed whether the business makes profit or losses. Preference shareholders are not involved in the decision making of the organization and also not involved in the voting for various decision of the company. In sharing of profits preference stakeholder are considered first before the ordinary shareholders. The associated cost with the share capital is dividends (share of profits) shares out with new shareholders.
                </p>
                
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">

                  Retained earnings belong to the ordinary shareholders.
